Eduarda Reolon - Graph

Description: This program implements a graph class with at least:

 - a function to add a new vertex to the graph (perhaps add_vertex(vertex_name)),
 - a function to add a new edge between two vertices of the graph (perhaps add_edge(source, destination) or source.add_edge(destination)),
 - a function for a shortest path algorithm (perhaps shortest_path(source, destination)),
 - a function for a minimum spanning tree algorithm (example min_span_tree()).

Design: 

The first step of designing this program is to understand what is a graph. In computer science a graph is an abstract data type and, according to Layman's definition, a graph is a network that defines the relationship between components in our system. See below:

The circles are refered to vertix(singular)/vertices(plural) or nodes and they are the components that form the graph.

The arrows define the relationship betweent the components and are referred to as edges.
